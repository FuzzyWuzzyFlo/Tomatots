            <h2>Groceries</h2>
            <p> The big grocery store chains in Tomakomai consist of <b>MaxValu, Food D, Coop, Big House, Trial, and Gyomu Super</b>! Personally, my go-to was always MaxValu, they are probably the biggest chain of the ones listed and tend to have the most options, but don't let 
                my experience sway you, definitely check them all out to see your preference. A hidden gem is Gyomu Super! This is like Tomakomai's equivalent to an international foods store. This store would be your best bet if you needed some special ingredients that you can't 
                typically find in the normal supermarkets here. There is a decent variety of imported goods there so it is a treat especially if you're beginning to feel homesick.
            </p>
            <h2>AEON, Donki, Nitori</h2>
            <p> This is the holy trinity of big stores here. You can pretty find anything you need at these stores.<br> <b>AEON</b> one of the biggest chain malls in Japan. Surprisingly, Tomakomai has the biggest AEON mall in all of Hokkaido! So there you can get the most American-like mall experience there.
                They have everything from a movie theater, arcade, bowling alley, plentiful clothing shops, electronics, a grocery store, a food court and so much more! Definitely it was a treat to have this! Namely, my favorite store there was "Kaldi," another international foods store (like Gyomu) but this store 
                tends to be a bit on the pricer side. However, I found some great hard to get foods there like falfel mix, tortillas, and good ol' mac n' cheese. You really start to appreciate those things after not having easy access to them! <br><b>Don Quijote (or as the locals say, "Donki")</b> is what I'd like to call the Walmart of Japan. You can find literally anything here.
                Whether its food, cosmetics, electronics, cooking supplies...You dream it, you can buy it! Donki is located right at Tomakomai Station which makes it convenient if you need to get something on your way home!<br>
                Lastly, <b>Nitori</b> is like the "Ikea" of Tomakomai. Here you can buy any furniture or home goods you may need. Sadly no Swedish meatballs, but you can find some nice decor or cute things to spruce up the place!
            </p>
            <h2>Cafes and Resturants</h2>
            <p> Idk about you but coffee is one of my love languages. I think one of the beauties of living somewhere new is finding the local shops and building relationships with the staff! I found trying new resturants to be some of the best conversational practice and a fun way to learn about the community! Tomakomai has so many hidden gems, I hope you can find some you fall in love with!
                If someone asked me to recommend three must try places in Tomakomai, I would say...: <br>
                <ul>
                <li><b>Ouchi Coffee: </b> Remi is the owner of this cute cafe! She speaks some English too which is great, definitely go have a chat with her! This place has some of the best coffee (her iced caramel latte is THE BEST), and tasty snacks! She also holds "Vegan Sunday" where the menu is entirely vegan for the day which was such a treat!</li>
                <li><b>Toncinis: </b> One of the best and most authentic Italian foods in Tomakomai! Michael is a real Italian man and you can definitely tell through the amazing food he makes! Definitely check this place out if you're hankering for some tiramisu or pizza!</li>
                <li><b>Coffee Kitchen TAPIO: </b> There are people who are Otakus for Japan, then there is this resturant owner who is an Otaku for Indian cuisine and culture. The lassi here is as sweet as the owners!
                 Definitely a hidden gem in Tomakomai! It has a great atmosphere and is next to a cute park golf place where you can compete with some Obaa-sans!</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h2>Nightlife</h2>
            <p> If you're looking for a night out on the town, downtown is where you wanna go. It a couple minutes walk from Tomakomai Station, and about a 12 minute drive from teacher housing!
                It is basically a couple of streets lined with many bars and some cute food stalls you can explore. Talking to drunk Japanese Grandpas was one of my favorite past times when I first arrived!
                There are always taxis lining the streets so no stress on getting home if buses and trains stop running (which is pretty early!).
