            <h2>About me!</h2>
            <img src="/media/IMG_5036.JPG" alt="Amanda's Picture" width="200" class="image">
            <p>Hi there! My name is Amanda and I was the Higashi High School ALT for three years from 2021-2024. During my time 
                there I learned so much about not only living abroad but how really make the most of any situation. My biggest advice
                for enjoying your time here is to get involved, and don't be scared to get out of your comfort zone and try new things (Think "Yes Man" with Jim Carrey). 
                For instance, before coming to Japan, I never touched ice skates yet I still joined 
                my school's ice hockey team and really dedicated myself to it! I spent weekends practicing and went to watch many hockey games!
                Not only was it fun to learn a new skill, I was able to connect with my coworkers and community despite the language barrier!
                I am now going back to America able to ice skate and a fervent hockey fan! 
                This city and community have so much to offer, I believe anyone can find their niche here, or discover new things about themselves if they open their hearts to it.
                This place is a hidden gem, but is up you to see its worth! 
                I know it is so scary starting out so I hope this website can help in any which way
                you navigate your new life~
                がんばれーがんばれー!</p>
