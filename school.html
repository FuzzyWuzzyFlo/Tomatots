                <p>As a highschool JET, you are under the mercy of the Hokkaido Board of Education.
                    This means you will have to visit schools both in Tomakomai and out of Tomakomai.
                    You most likely wil be at your base school (Higashi High School) three times out of the week, and your visit schools 
                    two days out of the week, but this can vary. Honestly, the visit schools were always such a treat to go to and I always enjoyed visiting even if was a journey to get there.
                    <br>Below I will list all the high schools you may visit and some general information about them.</p>

                        Who else can say they have a school that had a manga written about them? No, seriously, check out "Dogsred" by Satoru Noda!
                        
                        Higashi is your homebase and technically your direct supervisors. You will clock into this school, and if you need to call in sick, you will have to contact the school as well!
                        This is the school that will set up the groundwork before you arrive (aka housing, paperwork, time-off etc.)
                        and it will be the school you spend most of your time at (during winter/spring/summer breaks you will be at Higashi, no visit schools during that time).
                         Higashi is known to have the highest English ability out of all the high schools in Tomakomai. Higashi has a very welcoming atmosphere and many teachers will be eager to practice their English skills on you! The English teachers here are very kind and I always enjoyed team-teaching with them!
                        The workload definitely depends on the time of the year but it was always very managable. I never felt over-worked (quite the opposite).
                        Definitely there will be work lulls (namely, during breaks) but this gave me time to study Japanese or work on my own personal projects (kinda like this website)!
                       There are many ways and chances to connect with staff, at the end and beginning of the school year it is like 2 straight months of constant parties (enkais). This was always
                        a nice chance to connect with staff who may have been to shy to communicate! 
                        There are also many ways to get involved! For instance, the ALT before me was into choir, so he participated in music class and choir club. As for me, I joined Higashi's Teacher Hockey Team and I would sometimes join P.E. to participate in some free judo lessons!
                        I never ice skated before Tomakomai, but I am now proud to say I can play hockey! This was one of my best memories I made here! It is such a unique experience, and I am happy the school has that opportunity!
                        If you are interested in it please give the PE teachers a shout and you can join!
                        Maekawa sensei is the coach of the team, he is a PE teacher and was very warm and welcoming! 
                        I hope you find your niche! My best advice is to find something you want to explore and join the community in some way!
                        This was one of the best ways for me to build rapport with the staff, so I hope you can find your niche too!</td>

                        a nice chance to connect with staff who may have been to shy to communicate! 
                        There are also many ways to get involved! For instance, the ALT before me was into choir, so he participated in music class and choir club. As for me, I joined Higashi's Teacher Hockey Team and I would sometimes join P.E. to participate in some free judo lessons!
                        I never ice skated before Tomakomai, but I am now proud to say I can play hockey! This was one of my best memories I made here! It is such a unique experience, and I am happy the school has that opportunity!
                        If you are interested in it please give the PE teachers a shout and you can join!
                        Maekawa sensei is the coach of the team, he is a PE teacher and was very warm and welcoming! 
                        I hope you find your niche! My best advice is to find something you want to explore and join the community in some way!
                        This was one of the best ways for me to build rapport with the staff, so I hope you can find your niche too!</td>
